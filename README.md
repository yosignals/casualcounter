**Collecting Collectors**
---

### What's happening ?
Some are reaching into C2's that support metasploit staging and are executing to learn. 
There are a few stagers dotted around online just to collect, no interaction, just collecting their IP addresses to share

## Value ?
- If you're into blocklists here's one 
- Push Automated TI to become richer
- Highlight interesting signal (non CTI)


## Motivation 
Honestly, I didnt know why randoms where joining my teamserver, once I understood it, I thought 'Well, what can I get from this?'
